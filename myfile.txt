hello how are you so idek wtf im doing ok.
24, feels like I became a grown-up faster than everyone else
My life has been a movie, all the time
I ran to where the sun rises every single night
It's like I've been to someone's tomorrow
The boy who found the world too big
Keep on runnin’ errday, mic pic it up
Friends ridin’ subway, I’ll be in the airplane mode
All over the world rock on, I made my own lotto
But is it too fast? There're traces of losses
Don't know what to do with, am I livin' this right?
Why am I alone in a different time and space?
